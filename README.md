# ImBMS

ImBMS is a BMS chart editor built with [ImGui-SFML](https://github.com/SFML/imgui-sfml) using [SoLoud](https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud) for audio. It's still very much a work in progress but it's more or less possible to create a proper chart, although probably a pain in the ass without a lot of QoL features. I intend it to be cross-platform, however I have yet to test it on Windows; it may or may not work on Windows.

## TODO

- Copy and paste notes
- Selecting and manipulating multiple notes
- Support for long notes and hidden notes (they won't be erased when saving a file, they just aren't rendered and they can't be interacted with)
- Playback
- Plenty more I'm probably forgetting
